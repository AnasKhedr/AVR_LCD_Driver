# AVR_LCD_Driver
LCD driver for Atmega328p or any AVR MCU with a little editing.  
I stopped development\enhancement of this project since I finished development of the print() API "like printf for LCD" which was the reason for starting this project.  
You can commit to this repository or fork\download this it and continue your own development.  
Ignore the license of this project. You can do what you want with it without getting back to me.
